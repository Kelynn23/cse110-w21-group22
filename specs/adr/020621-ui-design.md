## Context and Problem Statement

We settled on features and now need a UI design

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Ease of coding
* Ease of use 
* Range of features
* Number of features


## Considered Options

* [#1](img/design-option-1.png) [https://youtu.be/D03nxURWssc](https://youtu.be/D03nxURWssc)
* [#2](img/design-option-2.png) [https://youtu.be/L5qrPKBXScE](https://youtu.be/L5qrPKBXScE)
* [#3](img/design-option-3.png) [https://youtu.be/SroILT3X9Q4](https://youtu.be/SroILT3X9Q4)
* [#4](img/design-option-4.png)

We had a team vote with 3 for #1, 1 for #2, 0 for #3, 3 for #4. Because of this, we made #5 which combined our favorite features of #1 and #4.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Our final design was [#5](img/design-option-4.png) which looked like this in [high-fidelity](img/final-design.png) because it combined simplicity of design, range of functionality and options, and fit our timeframe for coding.


## Pros and Cons of the Options 

* (Option 1 and 4) "I prefer the clean design in 4 but I think it's better for task + pomo to be on the same page. I like #1 in terms of utility but the only thing I don't really like is  the work/break/cycle bar idk it looks weird compared to the second design that was less cluttered"
* (Option 5) "Also I personally am a fan of that minimize feature"
* (Option 3) "The completiion list seems like it would be hard to implement"
