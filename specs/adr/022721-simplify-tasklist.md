* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [Brian, Kendall, Chanly, Yihe, Nicholas, Jennifer, Kelynn, Kevin, Catherine]
* Date: [2021-02-27] 


## Context and Problem Statement

Not enough time to test the tasklist integration with the pomotimer

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [Do we need a tasklist or not? is it worth spending time to work on this feature?]


## Considered Options

* [Remove the tasklist feature and just focus our time other features]
* [Keep the tasklist seperate from the timer so it is easier to implement and test]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Keep the tasklist seperate from the timer so it is easier to implement and test]", because [we believed that a tasklist is important to the helping the user stay productive].

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* [allows us to maintain the original goal of the feature while also giving us some time to focus on testing and finalizing other features]




## Pros and Cons of the Options 

* Good, because [it easier to test due to the tasklist being seperate from the pomodoro timer functions]
* Good, because [users will be able to keep track of tasks they have to do with the tasklist]
* Bad, because [the user will no longer be able to link the number of pomos they want to do to each task]
