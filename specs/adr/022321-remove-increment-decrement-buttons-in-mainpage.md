* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [Brian, Kendall, Chanly, Yihe, Nicholas, Jennifer, Kelynn, Kevin, Catherine]
* Date: [2021-02-23] 


## Context and Problem Statement

Say you want to increment the break time before you want to start using the timer you won't be able to. You would have to start the timer then wait until you reach break time to be able to modify it which prevents the user from being productive.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [is having the increment and decrement before the break time pomodoro like? is it helping the user stay productive]


## Considered Options

* [remove the feature to increment or decrement]
* [make it so the only way to adjust times is through the settings]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[make it so the only way to adjust times is through the settings]", because [we still wanted to give the user the option to customize the work and break times if they want to].

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* [allowed the user to change the times of all modes in the beginning]




## Pros and Cons of the Options 

* Good, because [user no longer has to wait for break time in order to modify it]
* Good, because [don't have to implement increment or decrement buttons]
* Bad, because [user will have to go into settings to see the option to modify the time]
