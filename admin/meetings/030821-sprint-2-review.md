### Notes
- Refactored all the code to be organized and modular 
- Made testing a lot easier (Jest and Cypress)
- Added Cypress testing
- Still need to work on better branching in the future 
- Pray we don't have merge conflicts when bringing everything up to main hehehe
- Feeling pretty finished
- Just have to do presentation
- Could crank out a bunch of ADRs but that's not what instructors want to see and we've done a relatively good job of keeping documents 
- Yay everyone is doing well
- Just have to finish some last logic, keyboard shortcuts, and tests for the new features 
- Dropped dark mode (or Panda mode) -- edit: kept dark mode
- Make sure issues are linked to features
