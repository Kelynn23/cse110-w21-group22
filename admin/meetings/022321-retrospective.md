### Sprint 1 Retrospective
  - Mad
      - "My test doesn’t work properly"
      - "Hidden deadlines"
      - "Merge conflicts and learning that everyone had different ideas about where to take our code were very hairy and very annoying to deal with."
      - "Our documentation/testing is gonna need a lot of work"
      - One thing I was mad about during sprint 1 was when I tried to incorporate jest part in our very first pipeline, because it took me quite a while to actually figure out how jest and Github actions work."
  - Sad
      - "We have a lot of documentation and testing to do"
      - "Wish we had more time to work on the timer (add extra features)"
      - "We're having a lot of trouble figuring out unit testing"
      - "One thing I’m sad about is I didn’t get to actually write unit tests for our project, and this would be what I’ll focus on during the next sprint."
      - "I think that we could have been a bit more ambitious and included more in our goals, but I understand that it's hard to gauge how much we can get done if we haven't done a sprint before. 
         As it is now, I feel the site is a bit bare-bones but that can always change."
  - Glad
      - "Glad we were able to break up our giant spaghetti timer function"
      - "We have the basic functionalities completed for the app"
      - "We accomplished everything that we set out to do before the sprint, and we made good progress towards a working site."
      - "Our mvp came together somewhat easily"
      - "One thing I’m glad at is I made some solid contributions to the product and during group coding I’m getting more familiar with other team members."
