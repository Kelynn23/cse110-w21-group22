### Sprint 2 Retrospective
  - Mad
      - we should have refactored our codebase in sprint 1
      - One thing that Iâ€™m mad/sad about was before we restructured the code, I spent hours trying to figure out jest but failed.
      - We didn't know much about modules beforehand and how to use them
      - Mad it took us this long to fix our mistakes
  - Sad
      - a lot of the sprint was used for catching up on testing
      - Took a while to figure out how we should refactor the code
      - Sad there is little time to left and lots of stuff to do
  - Glad
      - our app looks nice and we've completed a lot more testing
      - glad that we finally decided to clean up the code, not only making unit testing much easier, but also made the files&codes have a clearer structure. 
      - We were able to organize the code to make testing easier and still have time to implement extra features
      - Glad our stuff is more organized allow us to write and pass tests finally
