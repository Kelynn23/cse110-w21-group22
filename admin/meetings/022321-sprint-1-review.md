### Sprint Review
  - " I recorded audio for voice notification to inform the user when they were finish with their work time or break time
    made a function that would play the audio when the timer reaches 0 and will determine which audio to play based on the current mode. 
    Overall I think we made good progress on sprint 1 we just need focus on documentation and testing" - Chanly
  - "I was able to set up an alert for when the timer on the pomodoro app ends and also removed the stop functionality so that the timer only has start and reset." - Jennifer
  -  I did accomplish my goal of a working increment function, but I feel like I could have done more. I don't want to make changes that are not approved by the rest of the team though, 
     so I have to move at the pace of the group." - Kevin
  - I helped to implement the tab display feature and fixed some bug around the pomo cycles during sprint 1. Implementing these feels fine for me, since through the labs I’ve learnt pretty much what I need. 
    However I find writing unit tests challenging since it’s a completely new topic and it would take me some time to figure it out. - Yihe
  - "I added settings where the user can edit the lengths of work/break sessions and turn on an AutoStart feature. Overall we achieved the main goal of putting together a functioning MVP 
    but we could've done a better job with the SE process in this sprint" - Brian
