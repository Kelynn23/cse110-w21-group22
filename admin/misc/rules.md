### "Punishment" For Less Serious Issues
(ex. being late to meetings)
Use a random number generator, and they will do one of the following:
  1. 10 pushups
  2. Sing or dance for 30 seconds
  3. Make a post tagging everyone in the group with comment "These are my bestfriends :)"
  4. Show an embarrassing (appropriate) picture of yourself

### Recurring/Serious Issues
